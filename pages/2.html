        There is a wooden spoon, that lives on the counter
        in a drawer with a hundred things inside.
        <br>
        <br>
        This spoon is not really a spoon. It has a hole in the middle and it is flat, but I can't quite think of what else to call it. 
        <br>
        <br>
        This is my Mom's favorite item in the kitchen. She says she likes it for mixing, it does a better job, ”Especially for pasta” she says.
        <br>
        <br>
        I believe her. I like the spoon with the hole in the middle too, 
        I like it for mixing too. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I miss watching her pull it out of the drawer of one hundred things every night and watching her use it even when it is the worst utensil for the task at hand.

        Once, the spoon broke in half, it was mourned quickly then replaced with one that looked the same,only newer and with edges that were sharp rather than rounded.
        <br>
        <br>
        Worn down from the edges of bowls and the bottoms of pans and the insides of mouths when it was time to taste.
        <br>
        <br> 
        Now the new one is old and burnt in places it got left on the stove too long too. And it's edges are round instead of sharp.
