    <p id="spoontext">
        There is a wooden spoon, that lives on the counter
        in a drawer with a hundred things inside.  This spoon is not really a spoon. It has a hole in the middle and it is flat, but I can’t quite think of what else to call it.  This is my Mom’s favorite item in the kitchen. She says she likes it for mixing, it does a better job, ”Especially for pasta” she says.  I believe her. I like the spoon with the hole in the middle too, 
        I like it for mixing too.  I miss watching her pull it out of the drawer of one hundred things every night and watching her use it even when it is the worst utensil for the task at hand.
