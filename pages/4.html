        Sandollars remind me of my grandmother.
        <br>
        She has collected them for a long time.
        <br>
        She likes the ones that are whole, these are a lucky find.
        <br>
        I like the ones with cracks, I like trying to find the missing pieces.
        <br>
        <br>
        She is a woman that is smarter than she lets on.
        <br>
        She sends me letters in the mail most months.
        <br>
        Sometimes she tells me
        <br> about shells she finds on the beach,
        <br>
        about art she likes, about her days in college, 
        <br>
        about how she misses me.
        <br>
        <br>
        She has always been a sender of letters,
        <br> of cookies that turn to crumbs in the mail,
        <br>
        of banana bread that turns to brick in the tinfoil package.
        <br>
        She is a giver and a teacher and a lover so deep.
        <br>
        <br>
        She misses many people.
        <br>
        I miss her very much too.
        <br>
        My nana loves history and books and puzzles.
        <br>
        She taught me the joy of making.
        
        Of sewing and baking and writing and little treasures,
        <br>
        like sanddollars.
