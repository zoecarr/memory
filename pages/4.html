    <p>Sandollars remind me of my grandmother.
        She has collected them for a long time.
        She likes the ones that are whole, these are a lucky find.
        I like the ones with cracks, I like trying to find the missing pieces.
        
        She is a woman that is smarter than she lets on.
        She sends me letters in the mail most months.
        Sometimes she tells me about shells she finds on the beach,
        about art she likes, about her days in college, about how she misses me.
        
        She has always been a sender of letters, of cookies that turn to crumbs in the mail,
        of banana bread that turns to brick in the tinfoil package.
        She is a giver and a teacher and a lover so deep.
        
        She misses many people. I miss her very much too.
        My nana loves history and books and puzzles.
        She taught me the joy of making.
        
        Of sewing and baking and writing and little treasures,
        like sanddollars.
