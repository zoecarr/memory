<p>
    My boots were blue,
    <br>
    with yellow sunflowers.
    <br>
    They were for stomping.
    <br>
    In puddles, down the sidewalk, through the dirt in the garden.
    <br>
    They were for exploring and finding 
    rocks and leaves and twigs 
    <br>
    for making little houses in the tree trunks.
    <br>
    My boots took me everywhere, the sunflowers took me everywhere.
    <br>
    Now sunflowers remind me of the places I've traveled, imaginary and real.
    <br>
    They remind me of being outside for too long, of sweaty hands, and childhood. 
    <br>
    Sunflowers remind me of me when I was small, she inspires me.
    <br>
    I like how big they felt then and how they still feel big now.
    <br>
    I am glad that they are everywhere.
